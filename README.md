### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Georgi, a Java developer with a focus on creating high-performance and innovative applications. 

My professional journey includes actively contributing to the development of two exciting projects: Explore With Me and Share-It.

In developing Explore With Me, I worked with cutting-edge technologies such as 
Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Lombok, Spring Data JPA, and Java Persistence API. 
My proficiency in tools like Hibernate/JPA, Validation API, and RESTful API helped create a powerful and efficient application for time planning. 
I also have experience working with JSON tools like Jackson, enabling seamless data exchange between client and server sides. 
My skills in Maven and PostgreSQL ensured the reliability and scalability of the application.


The Share-It project also showcases my expertise in development. 
Here, I utilized Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Lombok, and other tools to create a service allowing users to share items and rent them for a period. 
My mastery of Java 8 Date/Time API and Java Validation API enabled the implementation of booking functionality and access management to items.
